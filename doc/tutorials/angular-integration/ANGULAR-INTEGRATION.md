# Angular integration

In this tutorial, we will create an angular project with a sample component that encapsulates a cnodes canvas. We are supported by typescript typings included in the **_cnodes-ui_** package, with a great experience!

Lets create an empty angular project by creating an empty folder and type following commands.

```bash
mkdir angular-int
cd angular-int
```

Create the empty angular project.

```bash
ng new
```
